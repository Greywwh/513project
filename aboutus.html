      <h2>Key facts about Luca and the bread!</h2>
      <p>LLuca commenced his career as a lifeguard but was laid off.
        He found he enjoyed making bread and experimented and in
         no time at all had built up a thriving business.</p>

      <h3>About Sourdough Bread</h3>
      <ul>
        <li >1. It has no store/commercial yeast</li>
        <li>2. Hand kneaded and shaped in-house</li>
        <li>3. Prepared over 14-17hrs</li>
        <li>4. Organic flour, the water is filtered and the electricity</n>
             used to power the oven is solar powered!</li>
        <li>5. Store bought bread is mixed and baked within 2 hours meaning</n>
             the gluten content is really high and can lead to someone feeling</n>
            clogged up when eating bread. Sourdough is a great alternative</n>
            and much easier to digest.</li>
